## QUICK FIX: Add These Attributes to Your Appwrite Database

### 🚨 Required Action: Add File Attributes to Collections

#### 1. POSTS Collection
Go to: Appwrite Console → Databases → community_db → **posts** collection

**Add these 3 attributes:**
- `fileId` - Type: String, Size: 255, Required: NO ❌
- `fileName` - Type: String, Size: 255, Required: NO ❌  
- `fileType` - Type: String, Size: 100, Required: NO ❌

#### 2. COMMENTS Collection  
Go to: Appwrite Console → Databases → community_db → **comments** collection

**Add the same 3 attributes:**
- `fileId` - Type: String, Size: 255, Required: NO ❌
- `fileName` - Type: String, Size: 255, Required: NO ❌
- `fileType` - Type: String, Size: 100, Required: NO ❌

#### 3. Storage Bucket (if not created)
Go to: Appwrite Console → Storage → Create Bucket
- **Bucket ID:** `community_files` 
- **Permissions:** Allow authenticated users to Create, Read, Update, Delete

### After Adding Attributes:
1. Update the post creation code to include file data
2. Test creating posts with image attachments
3. Images will display in the "image if any" section

### Current Status:
✅ Code is ready for file attachments
❌ Database schema needs the file attributes
⏳ Temporarily disabled file saving to prevent errors
