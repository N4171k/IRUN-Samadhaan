## Why Network Errors Happen

### Common Causes
- 📡 Temporary internet hiccup (most common)
- 🔥 Firewall blocking Google APIs
- 🌍 VPN interference
- 🏢 Corporate network restrictions

### Why It Needs Internet
Voice recognition uses **Google's Speech API** which runs on their servers (not your computer). That's why:
- ✅ Very accurate
- ✅ Supports many languages
- ❌ Requires internet

---

## Browser Support

| Browser | Voice Input | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Chrome ✅ | Full support | Recommended |
| Edge ✅ | Full support | Recommended |
| Safari ✅ | Full support | Mac/iOS only |
| Firefox ❌ | Not supported | Use text input |

### If Using Firefox
Text input works perfectly! Voice is optional.

---

## Privacy

### Your Voice Data
- ✅ Processed by Google Speech API
- ✅ Deleted after transcription
- ✅ Not stored anywhere
- ✅ Not shared with anyone

### What We Store
- ✅ Transcribed **text** (like typed messages)
- ❌ Voice recordings (never stored)

---

## Advanced: Test Speech Recognition

### Open Browser Console
1. Press `F12`
2. Click "Console" tab
3. Paste this code:
```javascript
const r = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
r.onstart = () => console.log('✅ Started');
r.onerror = (e) => console.log('❌ Error:', e.error);
r.onresult = (e) => console.log('📝 Text:', e.results[0][0].transcript);
r.start();
// Now speak something...
```
4. Click Enter
5. Speak when it says "Started"
6. See transcription in console

### Interpreting Results
- ✅ "Started" + transcription = **Working!**
- ❌ "Error: network" = **Connection issue**
- ❌ "Error: not-allowed" = **Need mic permission**
