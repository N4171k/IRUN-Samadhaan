## Manual Steps Required

### 1. Update User Preferences Collection
The existing user preferences collection needs to be updated to include the email attribute:

1. Log in to the Appwrite Console
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to Databases → community_db → user_preferences collection
4. Add a new attribute:
   - Key: `email`
   - Type: `string`
   - Size: `255`
   - Required: `Yes`

### 2. Update Existing User Preferences
For existing users, you'll need to populate the email field:

1. This can be done manually through the Appwrite Console
2. Or by creating a script that fetches emails from the Appwrite Users collection (requires proper permissions)
